# Unreal-ProjectEnigma

In this project I set out to create an Enigma machine, with the additional goal of having it be a "phyiscal" device in the game world.
## Implemented:
- Machine:
  - Input 
    - "Physical" QWERTZ Keyboard (Mouse interaction)
    - Player keyboard (keys A-Z)
  - Rotors (config chosen in editor)
    - Ring setting and Initial offset can be changed through player interaction
  - Reflector
  - Lampboard highlighting the encrypted key
- Player:
  - Interaction with objects
  - Camera Look
  - Crouch

## Currently working on:
- Plugboard (logic works, tweaking movement and interaction through cables)

## Planned features:
- Full Player movement
- Ability to swap out rotors with different configs during play
